# Why Your Kids Need AI Literacy — Not Just Screen Time Rules

Every parent I talk to has the same worry: *"My kid is spending too much time on screens."*

I get it. I'm a parent too. But here's the thing — **the screen isn't the problem. What they're doing on it is.**

## The Consumption Trap

Right now, most kids interact with AI in exactly one way: **passively**. They ask ChatGPT to do their homework. They scroll algorithmically-curated feeds on TikTok. They accept whatever the machine serves them.

That's not learning. That's consumption.

## What AI Literacy Actually Means

AI literacy isn't about learning to code (though that's part of it for older kids). It's about:

- **Critical thinking**: Understanding that AI outputs aren't truth — they're predictions
- **Prompt crafting**: Learning to ask better questions and give clearer instructions
- **Creative building**: Using AI as a tool to create, not just consume
- **Ethics awareness**: Knowing about bias, privacy, and responsible use

## The Skills That Matter

By 2030, an estimated 65% of today's students will work in jobs that don't exist yet. The kids who thrive won't be the ones who can use AI — everyone will be able to do that. 

**The kids who thrive will be the ones who can think with AI, direct it, and build with it.**

## What You Can Do Today

1. **Ask your kids what they use AI for** — you might be surprised
2. **Try building something together** — even a simple story or image
3. **Talk about how it works** — not the math, just the concepts
4. **Consider structured learning** — programs like Promptlings give kids a framework

The future belongs to creators, not consumers. Let's make sure our kids are ready.
