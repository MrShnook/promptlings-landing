# Sprint: Landing Page v3 — Matt's Review Punch List

**Date:** February 18, 2026
**Branch:** Create `sprint/v3-punchlist` from current `sprint/claude-code`
**Build:** `next-xi-eosin.vercel.app`
**Review doc:** Polylogue — "Product Review: Promptlings Landing Page (Cosmic v2)"

This sprint addresses 19 items from Matt's product review. This is a **polish and copy sprint**, not an architecture rewrite. Work inside existing components. Do NOT restructure routing, remove PostHog, or change the font system.

---

## Global Rules (Apply Everywhere)

1. **Age range:** Change ALL instances of "8-16" or "8 to 16" → "8-18" or "8 to 18" across the entire codebase
2. **Terminology:** Replace ALL instances of "track/tracks" → "path/paths" (e.g., "Pick your track" → "Pick your path", "Every track is led by" → "Every path is led by")
3. **"kid" → "child"** in professional/CTA copy. "Kid" is okay in casual body text but NOT in headlines, CTAs, or form labels.
4. **No emojis** in visible UI — replace with polished SVG icons or Lucide icons (already in deps). Emojis in comments/code are fine.
5. **Copy tightness:** Every section's body text should be ruthlessly concise. One sentence per point. No paragraphs where a sentence will do.

---

## 1. Navigation (`src/components/navigation.tsx`) — [fix]

### Logo (Issue #1)
- The logo currently looks wrong in size and presentation on desktop
- Set logo height to **36px** on desktop, **28px** on mobile, with `width: auto`
- Ensure the logo image has a **transparent background** (use `/img/logos/logo-1-nav.webp`)
- Add adequate spacing between logo and nav links
- The logo should feel proportional to the nav bar — not oversized, not tiny

### Mobile Menu (Issue #2)
- **Center-align** all menu items in the mobile Sheet/drawer
- Fix spacing: add consistent padding between menu items (at least `py-3` per item)
- Menu items should have clear tap targets (min 44px height)
- CTA button in mobile menu should be full-width with proper margins
- Overall: the mobile menu should feel intentional and polished, not an afterthought

---

## 2. Hero Section (`src/components/hero.tsx`) — [fix]

### Waitlist Form (Issue #3)
- Email input must be **full width** of the form container (not cut off)
- All form fields (email input, age dropdown, submit button) should have the **same height** (~48px)
- All form fields should have the **same width** (stack vertically, each full-width of form area)
- **Remove "optional"** from the age range dropdown label — just label it "Age Range" or "Child's Age Range"

### Hero Copy (Issue #4)
- Keep: `"Prompts. Builds. Create."` (tagline — unchanged)
- **Replace** the subheadline. Old: "Your kid won't just use AI; they'll master it"
  New: **"The future runs on AI. Your child will be ready."**
- **Keep** the description paragraph but update age: "Promptlings teaches kids ages 8 to 18 to become AI creators through live, small-group classes — not passive screen time. Real skills for the future."

### Mobile Hero Banner (Issue #5)
- The hero background image doesn't work on mobile — the content is not visible
- Add a **mobile fallback**: on screens < 768px, increase the scrim overlay opacity so text is always readable
- Consider using `background-position: 30% center` on mobile to show a more relevant portion of the image
- The hero MUST be readable on mobile without squinting — this is critical

### Dropdown Styling (Issue #6)
- Style the age range `<select>` dropdown to match the site's design language
- Use the same glassmorphic styling as other form inputs: dark translucent background, subtle border, matching border-radius
- The dropdown arrow should be a custom chevron icon positioned correctly (right-aligned with padding)
- On open, the dropdown options should also be styled if possible (note: native `<select>` options have limited styling — consider using a Radix Select or shadcn Select component for full control)

---

## 3. Remove Trust Signal Cards (Issue #7)

- **Remove** the `<TrustSignals />` component from `src/app/page.tsx`
- These are the small cards/badges that appear right below the hero section
- Matt says they break up the flow and are net negative — the same info is conveyed elsewhere
- Do NOT delete the file yet (it may be repurposed for the "For Parents" section later) — just remove from page.tsx

---

## 4. Problem Section (`src/components/what-is-promptlings.tsx`) — [tweak]

### Copy Rewrite (Issue #8)
**Current:** Long-winded fear-based copy with dubious stats graphic on the right.

**Replace with:** Clean, full-width section. The angle is **opportunity, not fear**. Tight, punchy copy.

**New section header:** "The AI Generation" or "The Opportunity"

**New copy (max 3-4 short lines):**
> AI isn't coming — it's already here. Your child uses it every day without thinking about it.
>
> The kids who thrive won't just use AI. They'll know how to build with it, think with it, and make it work for them.
>
> Promptlings turns passive consumers into active creators.

**Layout:**
- Switch to **full-width** (remove the two-column split)
- Remove the right-side stats/graphic entirely
- Center the text with max-width ~700px
- Consider a subtle supporting visual below the text — a "Consumer → Creator" concept using our mascot characters, OR just let the copy stand alone with generous whitespace

### Style
- Section background: consistent with site (navy-deep or slight gradient)
- Text: clean hierarchy — headline in Orbitron, body in Space Grotesk
- Keep it breathable — this section should feel like a moment of clarity, not a wall of text

---

## 5. Course Tiers (`src/components/course-tiers.tsx`) — [tweak + fix]

### Section Header (Issue #9)
- Keep `"// Choose Your Path"` (Matt likes this)
- **Replace** subheader copy. New:
  > "Pick the path that matches your child's age and watch them level up."
- Remove any reference to "tracks" — use "paths" throughout
- Keep the mascot-to-path connection implicit (characters are on the cards)

### Card Parallelism (Issue #10)
- All three cards must have **equal height** (use CSS grid or flex with `items-stretch`)
- Each card gets **exactly 4 bullet points** following a consistent structure:

**Explorers (Pip) — Ages 8-10:**
1. Design your own AI chatbot buddy
2. Create art and stories with AI tools
3. Build a working story generator
4. Learn prompt crafting and creative thinking

**Builders (Giga) — Ages 11-13:**
1. Code a real web app from scratch
2. Train your own mini AI model
3. Automate everyday tasks with AI
4. Develop Python basics and data thinking

**Creators (Nova) — Ages 14-18:**
1. Ship a portfolio-ready project
2. Build with real APIs and developer tools
3. Present your work to an expert panel
4. Master full-stack development and AI integration

- Each bullet should follow the same grammatical structure: action verb → object → outcome/context
- Mascot name is **Pip** for Explorers (NOT Byte — corrected by Matt)

---

## 6. How It Works (`src/components/how-it-works.tsx`) — [fix + tweak]

### Remove Decorative Cards (Issue #11)
- Remove any floating/decorative cards in this section that don't convey information
- Keep only the core step-by-step content

### Section Cleanup (Issue #12)
- **Replace all emojis** with Lucide icons (e.g., `<Compass />` for step 1, `<Users />` for step 2, `<Rocket />` for step 3, `<Trophy />` for step 4). Import from `lucide-react`.
- **One sentence per step** — cut all multi-sentence descriptions to a single clear line:
  - Step 1 (Pick your path): "Choose Explorers, Builders, or Creators based on your child's age."
  - Step 2 (Join a small group): "Get matched with 3-7 peers and a live instructor."
  - Step 3 (Build real projects): "Every session ends with something your child made — not just watched."
  - Step 4 (Level up): "Track progress, earn achievements, and build a portfolio."
- **Tighter spacing** between steps — reduce vertical gaps
- Replace "track" with "path" in step 1

---

## 7. Mid-Page CTA (`src/components/mid-page-cta.tsx`) — [fix]

### Form Fixes (Issue #13)
- Header and subheader should fit on **single lines** (no wrapping) on desktop. Reduce font size or tighten copy if needed.
- Apply the same form styling fixes as the hero form: matching heights, custom-styled dropdown, correctly positioned arrow
- Reuse the same `WaitlistForm` component (DRY — don't duplicate form code)

---

## 8. For Parents / Trust Signals (`src/components/for-parents.tsx`) — [fix]

### Audit Claims (Issue #14)
Only promise what we can deliver. Update the trust badges/cards to these:

**Keep (can deliver today):**
- ✅ "Full Lesson Transparency" — Parents receive complete lesson plans
- ✅ "Live Instruction" — Every class led by a real instructor, not AI
- ✅ "Small Groups" — Maximum 4:1 student-to-instructor ratio
- ✅ "Vetted Tools" — Every AI tool reviewed for age-appropriateness
- ✅ "Take-Home Resources" — Activity guides and practice materials after each session

**Remove or reword:**
- ❌ Remove "Progress Reports" (can't commit to individual reports in group setting)
- ❌ Remove "Parent Dashboard" (doesn't exist)
- ❌ Remove "Parent Community" (not built yet)
- Any badges referencing features we don't have → cut them

### Style
- Keep the section's overall structure (it's a good section per Matt)
- Use clean icons (Lucide) instead of emojis for badge icons

---

## 9. Meet the Founder (`src/components/meet-founder.tsx`) — [tweak]

### Bio Rewrite (Issue #15)
Replace the current corporate-sounding bio with this warmer, personal version:

**Headline:** "Meet the Instructor"

**Bio copy:**
> "AI isn't coming — it's already here. My kids, William and Nora, interact with it every day without thinking about it. I built Promptlings because I believe the kids who thrive will be the ones who learn to create with AI, not just consume it.
>
> Live instruction breaks through the insecurity of being a beginner. Small groups give kids the confidence to try. And building real things is the only way to actually learn."
>
> — Matt Martin, Founder

**Notes:**
- Tone: warm, personal, first-person. NOT corporate.
- The angle is opportunity ("the future is here, let's prepare") not criticism ("other solutions are bad")
- Keep it to these 2-3 short paragraphs max
- The photo placeholder should support a real photo later (Matt will provide). For now, keep the placeholder but make it sized for a **headshot** (square, ~200x200, rounded)

---

## 10. FAQ Section (`src/components/faq-section.tsx`) — [tweak]

### Expand Answers (Issue #16 / FAQ feedback)
- Keep the FAQ section (confirmed by Matt — good for PostHog instrumentation)
- Make answers **more verbose and tier-specific** where relevant
- This is where parents make decisions — give them real substance

**Rewrite "What will my child actually learn?":**
> **Explorers (ages 8-10):** Your child will learn to talk to AI using prompt engineering, create art and stories with AI tools, and build their first working project — a chatbot or story generator they design themselves.
>
> **Builders (ages 11-13):** Students dive into coding with Python, build real web applications, and learn to train simple AI models. They'll automate tasks and develop computational thinking skills.
>
> **Creators (ages 14-18):** Advanced students build portfolio-ready projects using real developer tools and APIs. They'll present their work to expert panels and develop skills directly applicable to college and careers.

**Add these new questions:**

- **"Who teaches the classes?"**
  > Every class is taught by Matt Martin, Promptlings' founder and an experienced AI professional. This isn't a marketplace of random tutors — it's one instructor who knows every student by name. Matt brings real-world AI experience from the enterprise space, translated into projects kids actually care about.

- **"What tools do you use?"**
  > We use industry-standard AI tools including ChatGPT, Claude, and creative AI platforms — the same tools professionals use daily. Every tool is vetted for age-appropriateness and used in a supervised, instructor-led environment. No downloads required — everything runs in the browser.

- **"What if my child has zero experience with AI?"**
  > That's exactly who we built this for. Our Explorer path is designed for complete beginners. Your child will start with the basics — how to talk to AI, how to evaluate its responses, and how to use it creatively. No coding experience needed. Just curiosity.

### Ensure full 10-question FAQ
Keep existing good questions, replace weak ones, add the new ones above. Target exactly 10 questions total. Each answer should be **3-5 sentences** — substantive but scannable.

---

## 11. Footer CTA (`src/components/footer-cta.tsx`) — [fix]

### Copy + Form (Issue #17)
- Change headline to: **"Ready to Launch Your Child's AI Journey?"**
- **Remove** "The early birds get 50% off" — strike this entirely
- Subheader: keep brief, one line. Something like: "Join the waitlist for early access and founding member pricing."
- Apply same form fixes: matching field heights, styled dropdown, remove "optional" from age, correct arrow position
- Reuse `WaitlistForm` component

---

## 12. Footer (`src/components/footer.tsx`) — [fix]

### Social Icons (Issue #18)
- Replace all custom/cute social icons with **standard brand icons**
- Use `lucide-react` icons or import the actual SVG brand marks:
  - Instagram: `<Instagram />` from lucide
  - YouTube: `<Youtube />` from lucide
  - LinkedIn: `<Linkedin />` from lucide
  - TikTok: Use a simple SVG icon (lucide doesn't have TikTok — embed an SVG or use `react-icons/si` → `SiTiktok`)
- Each icon should link to `#` for now (we'll add real URLs later)

### Logo
- Fix the secondary Promptlings logo: must have **transparent background** and be appropriately sized (similar treatment as nav logo)
- Height: ~32px in footer

### Legal Links
- Add footer links for: **Terms of Service** | **Privacy Policy** | **Refund Policy**
- Link to: `/terms`, `/privacy`, `/refund` (pages will be created separately)
- Style: small text, muted color, separated by pipes or dots

---

## 13. Legal Pages — NEW

Create three new pages:

### `/terms` (`src/app/terms/page.tsx`)
Standard Terms of Service for an educational service. Include:
- Service description (live online AI classes for kids 8-18)
- User eligibility (parent/guardian must register on behalf of minor)
- Acceptable use policy
- Intellectual property (student projects belong to students)
- Limitation of liability
- Governing law (Arizona)

### `/privacy` (`src/app/privacy/page.tsx`)
Privacy Policy with COPPA considerations:
- What data we collect (parent email, child's age range, first name)
- How we use it (class enrollment, communications)
- We do NOT sell data
- We do NOT collect data directly from children under 13 without parental consent
- Data retention and deletion rights
- Contact info for privacy questions

### `/refund` (`src/app/refund/page.tsx`)
Refund/Cancellation Policy:
- Full refund if cancelled 48+ hours before first class
- Pro-rated refund for unused sessions
- No refund for completed sessions
- How to request (email)

**Style:** All three pages use the same layout — dark background consistent with site, clean readable text (Space Grotesk), max-width ~800px centered, proper heading hierarchy. Simple and professional.
